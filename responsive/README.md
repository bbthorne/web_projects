lab 5
6.5.17

The files index.html and responsive.css build a webpage that changes which 
portion of software.png is displayed depending on the size of the browser 
window. 
	- index.html is left unchanged 
	- responsive.css uses media queries to determine when to display 
	  the proper section of the image. It follows the rules detailed in
	  the specification of the assignment. 

This lab took me about 1 hour to complete.

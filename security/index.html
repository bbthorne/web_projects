        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The product is a web app that stores the locations of users and
           displays them on webpages. I have been hired to find any possible
           security issues with the application, which uses Node.js, Express,
           and MongoDB.
        </p>

        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <p> After the burp suite provided too many installation difficulties to
        prove useful, I scanned the source code myself and identified areas
        of insecurity. I then verified these concerns using curl to manipulate
        URLs.
        </p>

        <h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
        <p> I have found a number of potential areas of attack in the application.
            The most severe has to do with cross-site-scripting (XSS), which
            enables a user to insert information or even dangerous code into the
            database. This is a vulernability due to the handling of input to the
            database. Another issue is the ability to override login information,
            allowing a client to access information that they do not have permissions
            for. This poses a security risk for the clients of the service. Also, the
            site is set up such that any other site can request data from the server,
            potentially damaging it or accessing its data.
        </p>

        <h1>Issues Found</h1>
        <p>
        All observations were made by running the web application locally. <br />
        <br />

        The first issue found was the ability to insert data to the system using
        a cUrl command in the terminal, which is an XSS attack. This is due to the application's
        dependence on user input for "login", "lat", and "lng". I found this
        vulernability by searching for fields in server-vuln.js that were filled
        by user input. The /sendLocation
        route asks for and uses this input, which can be specified using cUrl. After submitting
        "curl --data "login=Ben&amp;lat=5&amp;lng=4" http://localhost:3000/sendLocation"
        into the terminal shell, a new entry is added to the server, with login Ben,
        lat 5, and lng 4. The result, when running the main page of the app,
        lists this false entry: <br />
        <img src="pic1.png" alt="pic1">

        <br />
        This issue could be extremely severe, depending on what is added to the
        database. If it is malicious code, the result could be disastrous for
        the site and/or the clients. This issue could be resolved by not displaying
        user-inputted data in HTML, which would prevent potentially dangerous
        code from running.

        <br />
        <br />

        The second issue has to do with access to information within the database,
        which can be breached with a NoSQL injection. Since the route /checkins.json
        uses a login as a key, a clever use of the NoSQL injection "$ne" can be added to reveal all of
        the data in the server. Going to the /checkins.json route normally opens up
        a set of empty brackets, but if "?login[$ne]="definitely_not_a_name_in_the_database",
        the site reveals all entries that do not correspond with the login "definitely_no_a_name_in_the_database":
        <img src="pic2.png" alt="pic2">

        <br />
        This is a moderate issue, as although it does compromise information about
        the users of the application, it does not pose an immediate threat to the
        application itself. Since this database does not contain vital information
        about its users, the result of an attack in this way will likely be harmless.
        That being said, this can be avoided by not using the exact MongoDB syntax,
        encoding the function so that the attacker cannot find an entryway into
        the application.

        <br />
        <br />

        The third issue has to do with CORS and the Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
        permissions given for the server. This means that any website can make an
        XHR request to the server. Since all other webpages are authorized to
        access this server, another site can access the data in the server with a
        simple XMLHttpRequest:
        <img src="pic3.png" alt="pic3">

        <br />
        This is a serious issue, as other sites are able to make requests to your
        server using client-side javascript. This could compromise information
        about the clients to further attack, as well as make your server vulnerable
        as well. The easiest way to solve this
        problem is to allow url(s) that are affiliated with this program to access
        any CORS-necessary items.

        </p>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        Overall, your application is not entirely safe, but not in terrible shape.
        The best way to solve potential security flaws is to examine how user-input
        is referenced or used throughout the code, and what that could mean
        for the safety of the site. NoSQL injection and XSS attacks are difficult
        to prevent, but the origin control issue should be a quick fix. Remember,
        never trust user input!

Lab 6: My Old Kentucky Home
6.8.17

This submission includes 2 files, index.html and style.css. Embedded in 
index.html is a script that annotates the video on the page. The annotation
contains one image of a child rolling on the floor and another of the state
of Kentucky. 

Everything submitted adheres to the specification. 

I spent approximately 2 hours on this assignment.
